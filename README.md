 A shape is defined (for the purpOsCs of this assignment) as either a square, rectangle, or a circle. Define the classes Square, Rectangle, Circle, and Shape, with the appropriate instance variables, constructors, and getters.
 All shapes have a perimeter and an area. Define the methods perimeter and area, in such a way that one lan invoke both methods on any Shape variable. If we want to work with shapes on a computer screen, cach shape needs not only a size but a location: add a "center" property (a Posn) so that every Shape
 has a center.
 Define a method contains which takes in a Shape and a Posn, and tells whether the shape contains the position
